## Project Aims:

The main goal when deciding to build my portfolio website, was to improve my web development skills. As such I decided I not to use any frontend frameworks or libraries to aid me.

### Project targets:

* **Responsive** - The website had to work regardless of device used.
* **Accessible** - The website had to be accssible for all users including those who use screen readers. 
* **Browser Support** - Website functionally should work on all *currently supported* browsers. 

## Current Issues:
